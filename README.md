This project contains the sample code for the [_Apache Camel Developer's Cookbook, 2nd Edition_](http://www.packtpub.com/apache-camel-developers-cookbook/book)
(Packt Publishing, TBD 2017) by [Scott Cranton](https://github.com/scranton), [Jakub Korab](https://github.com/jkorab), and [Christian Posta](https://github.com/christian-posta).
The latest version of this code is available on [GitHub](http://github.com/CamelCookbook/camel-cookbook-examples).

*This project is up to date with [Apache Camel 2.20.0](http://camel.apache.org/camel-2200-release.html).*

All of the examples are driven through JUnit tests, and are collectively structured as a set
of Apache Maven projects. To execute them, you will need a copy of the [Java 8 JDK](http://openjdk.java.net/install/)
and an [Apache Maven 3](http://maven.apache.org/) installation. 
Maven will download all of the appropriate project dependencies.

In order to execute all the tests, all you need to do is run:

    $ mvn clean install
